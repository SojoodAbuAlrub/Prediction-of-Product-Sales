# Prediction-of-Product-Sales

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting future sales based on historical data. The project involves data collection, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and model development using various algorithms. The goal is to create an accurate sales forecasting model to help businesses optimize inventory management and improve decision-making.

#Features:
Data preprocessing and cleaning
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Model training with algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting
Model evaluation and tuning
Visualization of predictions and insights

- Python
- Libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib
- Visualization tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Explore the code, contribute to the development, and use the insights to enhance sales strategies.

Team: This project was developed by three dedicated data science students:
Sojood AbuAlrub, Mohemmed Qwasmi, Oday Qtit.
